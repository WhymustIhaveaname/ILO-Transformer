Attack ILO (International Linguistics Olympiad) using Transformer.

## About ILO

The IOL is one of 13 International Science Olympiads for secondary school students, and has been held annually since 2003.
Each year, teams of young linguists from around the world gather and test their minds against the worldâ€™s toughest puzzles in language and linguistics.

No prior knowledge of linguistics or languages is required: even the hardest problems require only your logical ability, patient work, and willingness to think around corners.
